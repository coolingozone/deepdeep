# Introduction to Tensorflow

Tensorflow is the a Open Source framework for Machine Intelligence developed by Google. It using data flow graphs to enable user to easily deploy numberical computation for machine learning. It's flexible architecture allows user  to deploy their computation to multiple CPU or GPU environment whether on desktop, server or mobile device or even embedded system such as Raspberry PI.

You could go to [Tensorflow Site](https://www.tensorflow.org/) to download or learn how to develop with Tensorflow.

Instruction to install Tensorflow on different platforms:
